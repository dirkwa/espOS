 * GET /api/v1/n2k — what the CAN bus is actually doing.
 *
 * This exists because of a question that could not be answered: the panel's
 * NMEA 2000 bus went quiet, its candump socket accepted a connection and
 * then delivered nothing for thirty seconds, and there was no way to tell
 * from the network whether the bus was unplugged, the bitrate was wrong, the
 * driver had never started, or the boat was simply silent. The counters that
 * distinguish those already existed inside the node; nothing exposed them,
 * and the health condition reports "normal" for a bus that has never spoken
 * as well as for a healthy one.
 *
 * Reading the answer:
 *
 *   running=false          the driver never came up. Pins, or a failed
 *                          twai_new_node_onchip. Nothing else matters.
 *   frames=0 errors=0      nothing on the wire at all: unplugged, unpowered,
 *                          or a bus where nobody is transmitting.
 *   frames=0 errors rising the bus is wired but not understood. ack_err on
 *                          its own means nothing else is listening;
 *                          stuff/form errors usually mean the bitrate is
 *                          wrong.
 *   frames rising          the bus works. If a client still sees nothing,
 *                          the problem is downstream of the receiver.
 *   dropped rising         frames arrive faster than they are consumed;
 *                          raise CONFIG_ESPOS_N2K_RX_QUEUE_DEPTH.
