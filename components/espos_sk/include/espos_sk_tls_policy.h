 * The trust decision for a SignalK server certificate — pure C, no mbedTLS,
 * no IDF. sk_tls.c parses the chain and hands the facts here; this file
 * decides what to do with them and is driven directly by a host test.
 *
 * The problem it exists for: a boat's signalk-server almost always presents a
 * certificate no public root signed — self-signed, or issued by a CA the owner
 * generated once. Verifying against the Mozilla bundle refuses every one of
 * them, and an "accept anything" switch would make the setting a decoration.
 * So espOS does what SSH does: trust on first use, then hold the server to it.
 *
 * Two shapes of anchor, because certificates get renewed:
 *
 *   CA anchor    the highest CA:TRUE certificate in the presented chain, plus
 *                the leaf's SAN set. A renewal signed by the same CA for the
 *                same names is accepted with no operator involvement, which is
 *                what makes a 90-day certificate survivable on a device nobody
 *                logs into. Binding the SAN set as well as the CA matters: a
 *                private CA that signs one host would otherwise vouch for any
 *                other name it ever signs.
 *   leaf anchor  the SHA-256 of the leaf certificate itself. Where a chain has
 *                no CA at all, or a leaf carries no SAN — signalk-server's own
 *                generated self-signed certificate is exactly this — there is
 *                nothing else to pin, and a renewal then needs one deliberate
 *                "trust the new certificate" from the operator.
 *
 * The decision table is the same one for tofu and ca mode: "ca" is TOFU with
 * the anchor supplied by the operator up front instead of captured on the
 * first handshake, so both walk the same code and are tested together.
