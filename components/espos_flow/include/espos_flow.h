 * espos_flow — one task, one clock, one mailbox: the runtime a data-flow graph
 * runs on.
 *
 * This is the C half. It owns a single FreeRTOS task (the *flow loop*) that
 * does exactly three things forever: fire whatever timers are due, drain
 * whatever other tasks have posted, and sleep until the next of those. On top
 * of it sits the typed graph in the espos_flow/ headers — producers, transforms and
 * sinks wired with connect_to(). Everything the graph does happens on this
 * task. Nothing else needs to exist for the C half to be useful: a firmware
 * that only wants "call this every 500 ms, and let me hand work to that task
 * from an ISR" can use espos_flow.h alone and never include a header.
 *
 * ── The threading contract ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * espOS today documents a different callback context per component: the
 * writer's task for a config change, the stream task for a SignalK update,
 * the esp_timer task for a health tick, the event loop task for ESPOS_EVENT
 * (docs/concepts.md, "Which task calls you back"). Every one of them is a
 * separate set of rules to remember and a separate chance to touch a variable
 * from two tasks at once.
 *
 * espos_flow replaces all of that with ONE rule:
 *
 *     Everything in a graph runs on the flow task. Every value that enters a
 *     graph from anywhere else enters through a Mailbox.
 *
 * So: a node's transform, a Poll's read function, a Sink's write, an emit()
 * anywhere — all on the flow task, one at a time, never concurrently. No node
 * needs a lock, because no node is ever re-entered. In exchange, nothing on
 * that task may block: a callback that sleeps stops every timer in the
 * firmware. Work that must block belongs on its own task, which posts its
 * result back with espos_flow_post() (or Mailbox<T>::post()).
 *
 * An ISR, a driver callback, another component's callback on its own task:
 * all of them use espos_flow_post_from_isr() / espos_flow_post(), which is
 * the only supported way in. CONFIG_ESPOS_FLOW_CHECK_TASK (on by default in
 * debug builds) turns a violation into an assert with the offending task's
 * name rather than a corruption that shows up a week later.
 *
 * ── Cost when unused ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The loop task is started by espos_flow_start(), which nothing calls for you.
 * A firmware that does not REQUIRES espos_flow links nothing; one that does
 * but never calls start pays the code size and no RAM beyond the static
 * tables. The C++ graph starts the loop when a Graph is run, not when a node
 * is constructed.
 *
 * Threading of the API itself: espos_flow_post(), _post_from_isr(),
 * _now_ms() and _stats() are safe from any task. _every/_after/_cancel are
 * safe from any task as well (they take the loop's lock), though the natural
 * place to call them is the flow task itself. _start/_stop are for the
 * application's start-up task, not for a callback.
