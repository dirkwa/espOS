 * Wire-format helpers for signalk-server's BLE provider API. Pure C with no
 * BLE, network or FreeRTOS dependency, so it runs under Unity on the linux
 * host target - which is where the fiddly parts (hex case, defaulting,
 * buffer accounting) are actually verified.
 *
 * The formats are a contract with signalk-server
 * (packages/server-api/src/typebox/ble-schemas.ts). Two asymmetries are
 * deliberate and load-bearing:
 *   - advertisement `adv_data` is UPPERCASE hex, GATT `data` is lowercase;
 *   - an absent `with_response` means write-WITH-response.
