"""Merge an ESP-IDF build's flash images into one binary.

Reads the offset/file map the build already worked out
(`flasher_args.json`), so the offsets here can never drift from what the
partition table and bootloader actually need -- which is the whole reason
this is not a hand-written list of addresses.

    tools/espos_merge_firmware.py --build-dir build --chip esp32c6 \
        --out firmware-merged.bin

A merged image is what a USB flash wants: one file at offset 0, no
partition table to line up by hand. The OTA image is the app binary on its
own, which the build already produced.

    --require <name>   fail if that partition is missing from the build

Use `--require` for a data partition whose absence still yields a BOOTABLE
image, because those are the ones that go unnoticed: an espOS firmware
merged without its `storage` partition boots and serves a placeholder page
that reads as a firmware bug, and one merged without a wake-word model
boots with a dead wake word that no OTA can repair.
